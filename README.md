TOP - to do list project

In this project, I will create a to do list program using JavaScript that will allow the user to create different projects that they can add to do items to. There will be a home page in which the user will be able to view ALL to do items from all projects in one spot. Users will also be able to mark to do items as important and will be able to view those high priority items in another view.
